# Future Plans
I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in Information Technology at MU, I believe I will continue like this until graduation. After that I'm thinking I'll go back home to Smithville to live with my dad.

Theres a huge Facebook datacenter currently being built right on the outskirts of Smithville, and I'm hoping that it will be just finishing by the time I graduate. My plan is to apply to work there right as its being completed, as they'll be needing a lot of employees quickly. That way I'll be able to work in my prefered field and gain experience right out of school. 

I'm also thinking of taking some time soon to complete my CCNA certification, for working in network administration. I should be able to do that if I put my mind to it one summer, and having that would really give me a boost in the job market.
