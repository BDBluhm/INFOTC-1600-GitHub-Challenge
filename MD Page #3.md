# Education
I am currently a junior in the University of Columbia Missouri, I transfered here from the Missouri University of Science and Technology after my freshman year. I graduated Smithville High School in 2021, having completed my senior year online during ~~Covid-19~~. My last two years of high school, I went on the Northland Career Center program, where I studied the Information Technology course and earned a PCPro Certification. I was also given the oppourtunity to do an online internship at Cerner my senior year, working in data analytics.
Those years are what inspired me to pursue a degree in Info Tech.💻⌨️🖱️
