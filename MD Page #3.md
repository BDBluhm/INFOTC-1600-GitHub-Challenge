# Education
I am currently a sophomore in the University of Columbia Missouri, having transfered here from the Missouri University of Science and Technology after my freshman year. I graduated Smithville High School in 2021, having completed my senior year online during Covid-19. My last two years of high school, I went on the Northland Career Center program, where I studied the Information Technology course and earned a PCPro Certification. I was also given the oppurtunity to do an Internship at Cerner, working in data analytics. Those years are what inspired me to pursue a degree in Info Tech.
