# My Family
I have one living grandparent, a mom and a dad, and one older sister. I don't know the exact number of aunts and uncles I have, since I don't see them very often, but I've met one uncle and two aunts on my mom's side, and theres an aunt on my dad's side who I've never met. My mom and my sister live in Denver, Colorado, while my dad lives close by in Kansas City Mo. I often go back to visit my dad during the weekends I have scouting functions, or just need a break. 

I also own two cats, link to their images below
